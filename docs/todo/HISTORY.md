# Todo history

Expired/completed docs from `docs/todo/` land here, appended in date order, oldest first. Each
entry keeps the original filename and content as a dated section — see `CLAUDE.md` for the rule.

## 2026-09-04 — export-provider-contracts.md

Branch: `feat/export-provider-contracts` (checkout: `tahti-export-api`).

### Goal

Expose versioned ExportProvider submit/status/webhook contracts so Nuclear can
move past metadata/deep-link export targets.

### Plan

1. Shared Zod DTO + list registry (Revelator real paths).
2. `GET /api/me/export-plugins` + thin submit/status aliases + webhook stub.
3. Credential lifecycle doc pointing at `/api/me/integrations`.
4. Tests + commit.

### Status

Shipped — see worklog `docs/worklogs/2026-09-04-export-plugin-contracts.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — listenbrainz-scrobble.md

Branch: `feat/listenbrainz-scrobble`.

### Goal

Submit-listens scrobbling via existing integrations credential store (not charts).

### Plan

1. Registry: `SCROBBLE` scope + `listenbrainz` provider; DTO + dashboard section.
2. `apps/api/src/lib/listenbrainz.ts` — validate-token + submit-listens.
3. Installer validates token before storing `{ userToken }`.
4. Fire-and-forget scrobble after successful listen-event create for session users.
5. Docs + unit/route tests; commit on branch.

### Status

Shipped — see worklog `docs/worklogs/2026-09-04-listenbrainz-scrobble.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — channel-designer-studio-rework.md

# Studio Channel Designer — uploads + section dropdown + help

## Goal

Rework `/dashboard/channel/edit` (core Studio) so it is usable:

1. Section **dropdown** (background, header/backdrop, player, tracks, collections, releases, …) instead of a tall vertical nav of instructional chrome.
2. **In-editor uploads** via `FileDropzone` — multi-image gallery DnD; video files auto-set header style to `VIDEO_LOOP`.
3. **Always-available page/background color pickers** (not buried behind visualizer ≠ MINIMAL / brand swatches only).
4. Move instructional copy into a collapsible **help** layer; forms stay compact.

## Status

Implemented on `feat/channel-designer-uploads-help` (2026-09-04).

## Verify

1. Open `/dashboard/channel/edit` — section dropdown at top of panel; no left vertical section list in the editor grid.
2. Background: change Background color — live preview wash updates (not stuck purple).
3. Header / backdrop: drop multiple JPGs into gallery dropzone; drop MP4 → header style becomes video loop.
4. Help (?) expands section instructions; forms have no long annotation paragraphs.


## 2026-09-05 — channel-look-extras.md

# Channel look-extras persistence

Merged: [tahti-org#435](https://github.com/janiluuk/tahti-org/pull/435) → `main`.

## Goal

Persist Channel Designer look extras that Nuclear previously kept only in
`localStorage` (`tahti.channelLookExtras.{slug}`) on the Channel model so
owner GET/PATCH and public channel/profile responses round-trip them.

## Status

Shipped on `main` (2026-09-04). Deploy prod next so migration
`20260904030000_channel_look_extras` runs. Nuclear client already sends
look extras on PATCH (`0.0.71`). Keep localStorage as cache until all envs
have the migration.
